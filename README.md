## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to utilize NYC Citibike data from the month of August to provide perspective on whether or not opening a similar type of bike share business would work in Des Moines, Iowa.  We were asked to use Tableau as the means to display our analyses.

## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
